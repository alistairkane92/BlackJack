An Android app based on the card game BlackJack

This was a Java project I created in one week whilst studying at CodeClan. The goal was to make an app which clearly
displayed the results of the game logic of both the dealer and the player.

My approach to this project was firstly to break up each step of the game, from placing a bet - allowing 
the player to decide Stick or Twist - displaying the results of the dealer's hand & card draw. I did this through utilising
different Views and making them Visible/Invisible to guide the user through each step.
